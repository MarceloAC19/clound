# Cloud Service Types

## **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
This involves the use of servers, security networks, and datacenters offered by a cloud provider. This model includes renting servers, virtual machines, storage, and networks, allowing users to install and manage their own applications and operating systems.
**Comparison:** The most flexible service among the three types, with self-configuration and management.

## **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
In addition to the resources provided by IaaS, PaaS includes development tools, providing an environment for creating, testing, and deploying software applications. This model offers pre-configured operating systems for use.
**Comparison:** Focuses on application development, with security management handled by the provider.

## **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
Includes the services of IaaS and PaaS, in addition to cloud-based applications like Microsoft Office 365 and Google Drive.
**Comparison:** Pay-as-you-go, usually based on a subscription model.
